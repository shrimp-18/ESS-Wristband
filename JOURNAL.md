Started researching what all components will be needed to make this.
decided to use an esp32 c3 devboard for its small size, a mpu6050, a waveshare 240x240 colour lcd.
Found all the parts on lcsc.

i decided to not use the Waveshare LCD i had previously decided on because it was small+expensive and had other stuff which i didnt require.
it was a rpi hat so i thought it would be better to use a generic display.
